# Unveiling Gender Disparities in STEM: A Comprehensive Analysis

**Contributors**: Veronica Mata, Homayra Tabassum

## Abstract
This project investigates the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields by analyzing social media data collected from Reddit. Using data mining techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), clustering, and sentiment analysis (using GPT-3), we uncover meaningful patterns in how women are either encouraged or discouraged from pursuing careers in STEM.

## Project Overview
The analysis explores whether societal discouragement or inherent lack of interest contributes to the gender disparity in STEM fields. We employed the Reddit API to gather a dataset of over 22,000 comments and 450 posts related to women in STEM. The data was cleaned, tokenized, and analyzed using various machine learning techniques to extract key insights.

### Key Highlights
- **Data Source**: Reddit API
- **Techniques Used**: LDA for topic modeling, OPTICS for clustering, GPT-3 for sentiment classification
- **Outcome**: Statistically significant evidence shows that discouragement is a larger contributor to the gender gap in STEM than a lack of interest.

## Skills and Tools
- **Languages**: Python (NLP, Data Cleaning), SQL
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, GPT-3 API, NLTK, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Techniques**: Clustering (OPTICS), Topic Modeling (LDA), Sentiment Analysis, Statistical Testing (Mann-Whitney U Test)

## Key Findings
- Women in STEM face more discouragement than a lack of interest, as evidenced by sentiment analysis and statistical tests.
- LDA identified five major topics related to socio-political identities, gender dynamics, professional environments, and general opinions.
- Clustering revealed two groups with supportive sentiments and two with critical views toward women in STEM.

- [Presentation Slides](link_to_presentation.pdf): A summarized presentation of the analysis and results.

## Conclusion
Our findings suggest that societal discouragement plays a more significant role than lack of interest in contributing to the gender gap in STEM. Future work will focus on refining the sentiment analysis with more advanced models like GPT-3.5 turbo.
